1. Can we only have Qty as manual entry and NOT scan?

Limitations:
If we scan Qty multiple times to aggregate Qtys for same UPC, the each Qty scan will produce a record.
When we load the record into DB, then we have to only pick the latest record

2. When a Product is added, then immediately you enter Delete action tag, then that Product is deleted.
This seems to be fine function, but if you don't want it then we may have to reset Product when Delete action is performed.
This makes the code complicated. We could prompt, "Do you want to delete item (Yes/No)?" as a solution.
